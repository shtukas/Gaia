# Gaia

Gaia is a spin-off/re-implementation of [Nyx](https://github.com/shutkas/Nyx-Ruby) where the regular file system is the repository.

# Todo
- Allow users to specify the location of their Xcache repository. (Currently hardcoded to use the existing one on Pascal's computer.)
- To be able to scan more than one location. 	
- Use the filepath package and its System.FilePath for multiplatform interfaces for file access

# Roadmap
- *In progress*: Recovering the functionalities of Gaia-Genesis 
- Implementing the web server and have basic online search
- Developping the Directives functionality
